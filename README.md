# webpack-brownbag-workshop

Hey welcome to the uDig Studio Webpack Brownbag!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites - Do this before the workshop

Note: I assume you have the latest Node and NPM versions [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* Install Yarn

MacOs: `brew install yarn`

Windows: [Installer](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-tab)

* Install Typescript

`npm install --global typescript`

### Installation

`yarn`

`webpack.config.js` contains a basic webpack build script that just bundles js and css

The config directory contains a split dev/prod webpack build

### Basic Webpack Build

`webpack --config webpack.config.js`

### Dev Webpack Build

`npm start`

### Prod Webpack Build

`npm run prod`

NOTE: This is a work in progress
